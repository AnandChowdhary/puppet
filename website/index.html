          <details>
            <summary>What are Secrets?</summary>
            Secrets is a form of encrypted text storage that allow you to store
            sensitive information. For example, you can store Secrets for your
            username and password to use Puppet when logging in to web services.
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Do you offer discounts to students and teachers?</summary>
            If you have an educational email address, you receive the Puppet
            Master plan for free. Just sign up with your school/university email
            and it will be activated. If you have an unrecognized institution
            domain, contact us with your ID and we'll set you up.
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Do you offer discounts to nonprofits?</summary>
            If you're representing a registered nonprofit in your jurisdiction
            (like 501/c in the US), let us know and we'll give you the Puppet
            Master plan for free.
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>How unlimited is unlimited, really?</summary>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Unlimited fair usage: As long as you don't crash our servers,
                you can use as many jobs as you like. We have a rate limit of
                100 requests per minute. We'll let you know if we're not
                comfortable with your usage, but this has never happened before.
              </li>
              <li>
                In the Puppet Master plan, we don't cap the job duration, but
                any running jobs will stop if we're running maintenance or
                updating our APIs. You should be fine as long as you don't run a
                job longer than tens of hours. This has also never happened
                before.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Can we request an SLA?</summary>
            We're happy to provide 99.99% uptime SLAs to Puppet Master users for
            an additional fee of $100/month. You can purchase this addon when
            you sign up.
          </details>

            <summary
              >Do you offer enterprise options or managed services?</summary
            >
            We're happy to offer a custom solution for your enterprise. This can
            be a managed service or increased rate limits on our platform.
            Contact us to discuss pricing.
